# 🍎 Fruit Ripeness Detector using ML & TensorFlow

This project is a machine learning-based image classification model built using TensorFlow in a Jupyter Notebook to detect the ripeness of fruits. The goal is to help automate fruit quality assessment using computer vision techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Determining the ripeness of fruits is important for food quality, supply chain, and customer satisfaction. This project applies **deep learning** to classify images of fruits into categories such as **unripe**, **ripe**, and **overripe** using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN).

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- 📷 Takes fruit images as input  
- 🏷️ Classifies them into ripeness levels (e.g., Unripe, Ripe, Overripe)  
- 🧪 Uses a deep learning model trained with TensorFlow and Keras 
- 📈 Achieves high accuracy using data augmentation, dropout, and CNN optimization

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🖼️ Image preprocessing and augmentation  
- 🧠 Custom CNN architecture using TensorFlow & Keras  
- 📊 Model performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix  
- 🔍 Real-time testing with new fruit images  
- 🧾 Jupyter Notebook for full end-to-end analysis and training  

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **OpenCV** (optional for image handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling
